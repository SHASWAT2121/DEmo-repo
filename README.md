# Top Module - SystemVerilog Project

## 🧩 Overview
This project implements a simple **SystemVerilog design** named `top_module` that demonstrates **signal mapping and bit extraction** from a 3-bit input vector.

The design uses continuous assignments to connect input bits to individual output signals and a grouped output vector.  
It’s a great starting point for understanding **port mapping**, **bit-level operations**, and **testbench structure** in Verilog/SystemVerilog.
